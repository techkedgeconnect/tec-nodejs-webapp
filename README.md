# Helm-ArgoCD Project for 2-Tier Microservices Deployment

## Overview

This project demonstrates the use of Helm charts and ArgoCD to automate the deployment of a 2-tier microservices application comprising a frontend written in Nodejs and a backend developed using Python (Flask). The project is designed to automatically deploy updates to the microservices whenever changes are pushed to the Helm charts in the Source Code Management (SCM) repository. The deployment takes place in a self-managed Kubernetes cluster on AWS.
