A 2-tier cloud-native microservices application deployment into a cloud environment, comprises application with two distinct layers, typically frontend and backend services. Each service runs independently in its own container or instance, and the deployment is optimized for scalability, resilience, and cloud features. Here's a brief overview:

# 1. Architecture Overview:
     Frontend Tier Microservice:
     - This is the user-facing layer, this microservice is built with Node.js (Express) technolog. It 
     - It is responsible for handling user interaction and sending API requests to the backend.

     Backend Tier Microservice:
     - This tier microservice manages the application's core logic, business rules, and data processing. It is built using Flask framework.
     - It is responsible for exposeing REST or GraphQL APIs to the frontend for data exchange.
     
# 2. Key Characteristics of Cloud-Native Deployment:
     - Containers: Each service is packaged into a lightweight container (using Docker) and deployed independently, improving portability and consistency across 
       environments.
     - Microservices: The two services are loosely coupled, meaning each service is self-contained and can be deployed, scaled, or updated without affecting other services.
     - Managed Infrastructure: This deployment leverages AWS cloud platforms that provide managed services like amazon ec2 instances, amazon ECR, container orchestration 
       (Kubernetes), networking, databases, and monitoring.
       
# 3. Deployment Process:
     - Containerization: Both the frontend and backend are containerized using Docker and deployed on ec2 instance and container orchestration platforms like Kubernetes.
     - Service Discovery & Communication: Services communicate over an internal network. In Kubernetes, services are discovered via DNS, and the frontend sends requests to 
       the backend.
     - Scaling: Cloud-native tools automatically scale each tier based on traffic. For example, the frontend might auto-scale based on user demand, while the backend can 
       scale to handle processing workloads.
     - Resilience: Cloud-native architecture provides built-in resilience with features like load balancing, auto-restart, and failover to maintain uptime during failures 
       or high demand.
       
# 4. Cloud Benefits:
     - Elasticity: The application can scale automatically in response to changes in demand, without manual intervention.
     - Fault Tolerance: Cloud platforms ensure that services remain available by automatically restarting failed instances or routing traffic to healthy ones.
     - CI/CD Integration: Cloud-native environments support continuous integration and deployment, allowing frequent and seamless updates to either the frontend or backend 
       without downtime.
       
This type of deployment offers flexibility, scalability, and efficiency, making it ideal for modern, dynamic applications that need to adapt to user demand and operational changes.
